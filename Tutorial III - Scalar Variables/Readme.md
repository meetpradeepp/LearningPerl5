#Tutorial III - Scalar Variables


In this tutorial lets learn how to use scalar variables. As you must be remembering the scalar
variables is defined using `$` sigil and it can be used to store any type of singular values.

This tutorial also covers multiple ways available in perl to access the values. These ways are to showcase the flexibility
available in Perl to access data. As we work with Arrays and Hashes in upcoming tutorials these basics would make more sense.

Rule of thumb
Single `$` sigil = value in the variable
Double `$$` sigil = value at the value stored in the variable

Please go through the program for various types you could access the value.
